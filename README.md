# amFOSS_shopping

In the beginning I thought that was a easy task ,but later on I realized that it needs some extra effort to make this code done.It took 2 days to make this program run successfully. Initially there were many bugs in the program(some of them were very hard to identify), but now I have fixed almost every bug in the code.I am gonna describe some of the important features in my program.

1.Clothing Category

In the men and women wear option in the program ,which took major portion of time in making the code.Usually when it comes to clothing ,different brands have different prices for different sizes.So I have took that into consideration and implemented in my program.So if you enter into clothes category, then you will get an option to choose your size and you just need to pay only for that size clothing.Isn’t that cool!!!

2.Email ID verification

Every shopping application has Login user email Id and password to only permit the user to shop.In the similar way my code asks the user to enter the email ID and password to login.It also verifies whether the user has input a valid email ID.I uses a simple code that checks whether there is “@” and “.” in the email ID.Isn’t that cool!!!

3.To remove unwanted items from the cart

Usually in the shopping applications we can remove unwanted items from the list,which are added to cart .So I have given the useran option  to remove unwanted items from the cart ,after he/she completes shopping.This is done simply be popping out the items from the list.

4.Time delay

If you run the program ,you will notice some time delay when printing the results.
This is done to give the user a feeling of shopping.When you enter your email and bank passwords, you can notice some time delay of 2 seconds.This 2 seconds will make the user feeling as if he/she is login to shopping application.

5.Payment

In the payment session I have added three payment options.(i.e net banking ,credit card, cash on delivery). User can choose any mode of payment.Net banking and credit card payment are created in such a way that the user feels as if he/she is going to pay for their items (because of time delay).

6.Coupon

Usually shopping applications provide a first time order coupon to user that gives discount to the user.So I have also provided coupon to the user that gives a discount of 4% to the user.There is another option for user that he/she can proceed to payment with out entering the coupon code.

7.Captcha reading

During login or payment in some applications ,the user should verify them self that he/she is not a robot.This is done by captcha reading.Captcha is a image that contains some text and numbers.The user is asked to enter the same text to verify whether he/she is not a robot.So I have used captcha reading in my code to verify the user.Isn’t that cool!!!

Last but not least , I have asked the user to give his/her feedback to the code at the end of the program.

So these are the features of my code.
I wish it will give you a nice user experience when running my code.
